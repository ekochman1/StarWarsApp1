# StarWarsApp1
Worked with Leo Connelly.
Android app contains 4 java classes: Movie.java, MainActivity.java, MovieDetailActivity.java, and MovieAdapter.java. 
The app contains a JSON file of Starwars movies

The function of the app is to be able to mark whether you've watched, haven't watched, or don't want to watch an epsode of Starwars. You can also view the main characters and decription of each episode.
